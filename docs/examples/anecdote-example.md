# Organizational Restructure During Hypergrowth

Example anecdote in STAR format for interview preparation (Engineering Manager/Director level).

## Situation

Engineering team grew from 12 to 35 people in 6 months during Series B hypergrowth phase. Original flat structure causing:
- Decision-making bottlenecks (all decisions escalating to CTO)
- Unclear ownership leading to duplicated work and missed deadlines
- Engineer burnout from context switching across too many projects
- Attrition climbing to 15% (industry average: 10%)

## Task

Restructure the engineering organization to enable sustainable scaling while maintaining team morale and delivery velocity. Had to complete within one quarter without disrupting ongoing product launches.

## Action

- **Discovery Phase** (Weeks 1-2):
  - Conducted 1:1s with all 35 engineers to understand pain points
  - Analyzed project dependencies and code ownership patterns
  - Surveyed team on preferred work styles and career goals

- **Design Phase** (Weeks 3-4):
  - Designed pod-based structure: 3 product teams + 1 platform team
  - Created clear ownership model with DRIs (Directly Responsible Individuals)
  - Promoted 3 engineers to Engineering Manager roles
  - Developed transition plan with stakeholder buy-in

- **Execution Phase** (Weeks 5-12):
  - Ran EM training bootcamp for new managers (weekly sessions)
  - Held team offsites to establish team norms and roadmaps
  - Implemented weekly staff meetings for cross-team coordination
  - Established clear escalation paths and decision-making frameworks

## Result

- **Team Health**: Attrition reduced from 15% to 6% within 6 months
- **Delivery**: On-time delivery improved from 60% to 85%
- **Autonomy**: Teams making 80% of decisions independently (vs 30% before)
- **Scale**: Structure successfully supported growth to 60 engineers
- **Leadership**: All 3 promoted EMs still in role after 2 years, managing 12-15 people each
- **Morale**: eNPS score improved from 25 to 58
